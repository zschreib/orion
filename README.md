# ORf Interaction Ontology Network (ORION)


ORf Interaction Ontology Network (ORION), a computational framework designed to explore patterns of protein cluster (PC) organization across genomes, contigs, or viral operational taxonomic unit (vOTU) sequences. By examining the arrangement of neighboring PCs, ORION identifies shared genomic features and highlights enriched PC regions. This approach leverages sequence organization by mapping each open reading frame (ORF) position to a PC. Cluster blocks (CBs) are defined by a sliding window of configurable size around each focal PC. The window length determines how many neighboring PCs are included, so a size of three captures the focal PC and the flanking adjacent neighbors, while larger windows encompass more distant clusters. Rather than relying on exact ORF coordinates, CBs utilize ORF position on a squence and the relative PC arrangement within each window, allowing consistent comparison of PC patterns even when ORFs shift due to genomic rearrangements.
